# OPTICS.DBSCAN-Clustering-Assigment

In this assignment, we applied DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) and OPTICS (Ordering Points to Identify the Clustering Structure) algorithms to identify meaningful clusters in our datasets. We used a thorough clustering methodology involving dimensionality reduction, feature selection, and evaluation of different parameter values to ensure optimal clustering.

We worked with two to three datasets to explore and analyze the results across different data distributions. For each algorithm, we discuss the effects of changing key parameters and explain the final clustering results.
